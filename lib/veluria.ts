/**
 * The Veluria range — the app's single source of truth for what the product can
 * and cannot do.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The app used to model "Veluria" as ONE hydrating skin booster
 * whose scope was hydration, glow, texture and fine surface lines, and which was
 * declared incapable of touching pigmentation, tone, laxity or scarring. That is
 * wrong, and it was costing bookings: those are the concerns most clients come
 * in with, so the report dismissed them ("beyond a skin booster's scope") and the
 * simulated result showed no change.
 *
 * Veluria is in fact PB Serum's BIOREMODELING line (Proteos Biotech, Spain;
 * Class 3 medical device, professional use only). Every product is built on
 * recombinant Collagenase G & H, which degrades disorganised collagen and drives
 * new collagen synthesis. Three of the four are for skin, and each targets a
 * DIFFERENT concern — including the ones we were refusing:
 *
 *   - Pearl Tone is sold specifically to target hyperpigmentation (glutathione,
 *     a tyrosinase inhibitor).
 *   - Ultra Lift is sold specifically for sagging and loss of firmness (DMAE).
 *   - Silk Skin carries PDRN, among the better-evidenced actives for post-acne
 *     scarring, and is anti-inflammatory (with Centella asiatica) so it calms
 *     irritated-looking redness.
 *
 * CLAIM DISCIPLINE. Everything here is phrased as an APPEARANCE claim, the way
 * the manufacturer phrases it. Veluria softens and evens pigment; it does not
 * erase it. It calms redness; it does not remove blood vessels. Anything genuinely
 * outside the range still says so — see OUT_OF_SCOPE.
 *
 * NOT CLAIMED: exosomes. PB Serum's marketing calls the platform "Exosomes +
 * PDRN + HA", but the Silk Skin INCI lists PDRN, a peptide and Centella with no
 * exosomes. Exosome claims attract ASA/MHRA scrutiny, so we claim only the INCI
 * until Sirona confirms otherwise.
